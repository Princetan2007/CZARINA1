            <h1>Avoid Misinformation</h1>
            <p>
                What is the importance of ensuring informed decision-making before voting?
                An informed decision is a fair or unbiased piece of information. It is important to be fair because we’re not the only ones who will benefit from it but also others. Think wisely because every decision that we made has consequences. We should choose the right leader to help us to be on the right path. As a result, having a good leader can inspire us to achieve things that we want in a good way.
                <br><br>
                Here are some tips of informed decision-making before voting: 
                <br><br>
                <strong>• Choose a leader that will prioritize other people</strong>
                <br>• We should know what are the abilities of the candidates
                <br>• We respect each of one’s choices
                <br>• Being honest all the time
                <br>• We should pursue what we have been started

                <h2>Ask Questions:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t be afraid to ask candidates and community leaders questions about their positions on key issues. Clarify doubts and seek information that may not be readily available.</li>
                    <li>Review the voting records, actions, and decisions made by incumbents and candidates in previous positions. Look at how they have handled issues in the past to predict their future behavior.</li>
                    <li>Make a conscious effort to separate emotions from facts. Try to avoid being swayed by charismatic speeches or negative campaigning. Focus on the substance of each candidate’s policies.</li>
                    <li>Attend town halls or candidate meet-and-greets to hear more about their stance on the issues and ask questions.</li>
                    <li>Be open-minded when it comes to voting. Choose a leader wisely who you surely think will have the potential to be a good leader for all.</li>

            <h1>Responsible Voter</h1>
            <p>
                Being a responsible voter is an important factor in our democratic country. It will shape the lives of the people, creating a massive
                impact on the community. Let’s unravel some of the characteristics to consider as a responsible voter.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>• Have awareness - We should be aware of the issues our country is currently facing so that we can see which leader is the most suitable in handling these issues.</li>
                <li>• Be mindful - We should only listen to sources that are trusted and provide factual information on the candidates. Do not immediately believe everything we see and hear without enough evidence.</li>
                <li>• Having a clear understanding of the campaign and election itself - We should always consider all the traits of the candidates, ignoring their social status or if they come from a family of politicians. You should check their contributions in the past and present, their aspirations, and their education.</li>
                <li>• Respect for others - Every person has their own viewpoints that may contradict others, being a responsible voter should respect others even if they may not support the same candidate.</li>
                <li>• Participation - Being a responsible voter is by actively participating in positive and beneficial activities during the campaign season.</li>
                <li>• There are a lot of characteristics a responsible voter should possess; we should always think of the impact it will have on us.</li>
